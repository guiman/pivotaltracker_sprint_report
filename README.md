# pivotaltracker_sprint_report


A simple web app to generate sprint review documents from Pivotal Tracker
projects.

##How does it work

Pivotal Tracker is a great product and I've enjoyed it both at work and on my personal projects. Now because of it's focus and simplicity, there are some features that are not present. Sprint Review documents is one of them.

We uses a small sinatra application to capture the minimum data required to generate the most basic sprint review document and present it.

I welcom everyone to fork the project an personalize it as you see fit.
